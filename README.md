# Heart-Diseases_Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning analyzes patient data using XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest to assess heart disease risk. The project is being enhanced with CNN for ECG analysis to improve accuracy. Future plans include deploying a web app for real-time predictions and visual analytics.
